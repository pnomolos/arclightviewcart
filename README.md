View Cart allows you to see the contents of customers who are currently viewing your store.  This is most useful if your store offers a selection of items that likely need to be combined (say, for example, a computer parts retailer) and customers are often asking if a certain combination of items is going to be compatible.

**Please Note:  If you are unable to see guests' carts or are having any other issues, make sure that "Store session IDs in database" is checked under Settings > View Cart settings.**


Installation
============
Create a folder called 'arclightviewcart' in your store/modules directory.  Git clone or use the 'Download ZIP' button in github to get all these files and put them in that directory.

Support
=======
None whatsoever.  You can use the 'Issues' button and I might get to things eventually.  If you open a PR and fix the issue then I'm much more likely to do that.
