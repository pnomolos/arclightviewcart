View Cart allows you to see the contents of customers who are currently viewing your store.  This is most useful if your store offers a selection of items that likely need to be combined (say, for example, a computer parts retailer) and customers are often asking if a certain combination of items is going to be compatible.

Please Note:  If you are unable to see guests' carts or are having any other issues, make sure that "Store session IDs in database" is checked under Settings > View Cart settings.
